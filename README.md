# WeatherAPP
A weather app that dynamically changes its color scheme based on the current temperature. Warmer temperatures trigger vibrant, warm colors like reds and oranges, while cooler temperatures shift to calm blues and purples. This visual cue enhances the user experience, making it easier to interpret the weather at a glance.
